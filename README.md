# Bike Thefts in Berlin - Data Analytics Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze bike theft in Berlin by expanding the existing database and incorporating additional data sources, including population density and other relevant factors. Through web scraping, SQL data analysis, and Tableau visualizations, I aim to identify trends, hotspots, and potential predictive models for bike theft in the city.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: I will gather historical bike theft records and use web scraping to obtain up-to-date information, crime statistics, and demographic data for different neighbourhoods in Berlin.

2. **Data Analysis and Joins**: Using SQL, I will perform data analysis and joins to merge the bike theft database with the scraped datasets, creating a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: I will use Tableau to create interactive visualizations, such as maps, pie charts, and graphs, to explore patterns, correlations, and hotspots related to bike theft in Berlin.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: I aim to develop a predictive model to forecast bike theft crimes in various locations.

## Expected Outcomes
- An enriched and up-to-date bike theft database for Berlin, providing a detailed overview of incidents across different areas.
- Interactive Tableau visualizations to identify high-risk locations and correlations with population density and other relevant variables.
- A machine learning model for predicting bike theft crimes, enabling proactive actions to create a safer environment for cyclists and residents.
